# Project-First-Amendment

This project is a Python Module which has different types of encryption algorithms.

To use bookcheck() you need to input the .book file. For example bookcheck("bookfile"). To output the list of characters after the use of the bookcheck() function put the bookcheck() function into a print statement for example print(bookcheck("bookfile")).

To use bookconversion() you need to input the .book file, and the .char output file. For example bookconversion("bookfile","charfile"). To output the Input and Output file name put it within a print statement for example print(bookconversion("bookfile","charfile")).

To use bookencryption() you firstly need to input the file that you want to be encrypted in this version the only characters that are allowed are (a-z,A-Z,0-9,Space,Full stop) they also can include multiple lines. This function also needs to have the .char file inputted to be able to encrypt the file and finally it needs the name of the file output. For example bookencryption("textfile","charfile","outputfile"). To output the encrypted text into the terminal put it within a print statement for example print(bookencryption("textfile","charfile","outputfile")).

To use bookdecryption() you firstly need to input the encrypted file with the .encrypt extension. Then you need to add the .char file which was used to encrypt the file in the first place and finally you need to add the name of the file which will be outputted. For example bookdecryption("encryptedfile","charfile","outputfile"). To output the encrypted text into the terminal put it within a print statement for example print(bookdecryption("encryptedfile","charfile","outputfile")).
