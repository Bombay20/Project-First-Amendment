I have to create function that scans the book file that checks for all chars so that there is no missing char.
Figure out how to convert a pdf and word document into a text that can be read into the program so it can scan for different char
I have to create a .txt file format to be able to tell which page and all that I could also create custom file with extension .book which will be able to tell the pages and char numbers

(.book file system ideas and theory)
At the start of the file there will be a number which says the amount of pages and char this can be used
to tell what the max of each is. e.g. [x,y] x = char y = page. After the max of each is shown the page number
will be shown between "()" this will make it be able to be recognised a lot easier than if it is plain text
without some sort of barrier.

e.g.
[12,1]
(1,3)
(a,b)
a = page b = lines

To show a new line or break in the text i will have the line wrapped in "{}".

e.g.

{hello this is great but}
{a new line is needed.}

"""
hello this is great but
a new line is needed.
"""
book encryption example
x.y.z = 1.5.6 = page.line number.letter number
a.b.c.d = 1.2.5.33 = capital.page.line number.letter number
x = page
y = line number
z = letter number
capital letter is 0 for lower case and 1 for upper
2.35.54,1.23.4,54.32.4
for new char it uses "," and for new line it uses "/"
