{the three farmers}
{down in the valley there were three farms. the }
{owners of these farms had done well. they were }
{rich men. they were also nasty men. all three of }
{them were about as nasty and mean as any men }
{you could meet. their names were farmer boggis, }
{farmer bunce and farmer bean.}
(2,5)
{boggis was a chicken farmer. he kept thousands }
{of chickens. he was enormously fat. this was }
{because he ate three boiled chickens smothered }
{with dumplings every day for breakfast, lunch and }
{supper.}
(3,9)
{bunce was a duck-and-goose farmer. he kept }
{thousands of ducks and geese. he was a kind of }
{pot-bellied dwarf. he was so short his chin would }
{have been underwater in the shallow end of any }
{swimming-pool in the world. his food was dough-}
{nuts and goose-livers. he mashed the liver into a }
{disgusting paste and then stuffed the paste into the }
{doughnuts. this diet gave him a tummy-ache and }
{a beastly temper.}
(4,6)
{bean was a turkey-and-apple farmer. he kept }
{thousands of turkeys in an orchard full of apple }
{trees. he never ate any food at all. instead, he }
{drank gallons of strong cider which he made from }
{the apples in his orchard. he was as thing as a pen-}
{cil and the cleverest of them all.}
