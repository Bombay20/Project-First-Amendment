£1{the three farmers}
£2{down in the valley there were three farms. the }
£3{owners of these farms had done well. they were }
£4{rich men. they were also nasty men. all three of }
£5{them were about as nasty and mean as any men }
£6{you could meet. their names were farmer boggis, }
£7{farmer bunce and farmer bean.}

£1{boggis was a chicken farmer. he kept thousands }
£2{of chickens. he was enormously fat. this was }
£3{because he ate three boiled chickens smothered }
£4{with dumplings every day for breakfast, lunch and }
£5{supper.}

£1{bunce was a duck-and-goose farmer. he kept }
£2{thousands of ducks and geese. he was a kind of }
£3{pot-bellied dwarf. he was so short his chin would }
£4{have been underwater in the shallow end of any }
£5{swimming-pool in the world. his food was dough-}
£6{nuts and goose-livers. he mashed the liver into a }
£7{disgusting paste and then stuffed the paste into the }
£8{doughnuts. this diet gave him a tummy-ache and }
£9{a beastly temper.}

£1{bean was a turkey-and-apple farmer. he kept }
£2{thousands of turkeys in an orchard full of apple }
£3{trees. he never ate any food at all. instead, he }
£4{drank gallons of strong cider which he made from }
£5{the apples in his orchard. he was as thin as a pen-}
£6{cil and the cleverest of them all.}
